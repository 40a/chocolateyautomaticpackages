    <description>AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a custom scripting language that is aimed specifically at providing keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.
AutoHotkey_L is a fork of AutoHotkey which adds a long list of new features and fixes some bugs. Anything that can be done with AutoHotkey can also be done with AutoHotkey_L. Scripts written for AutoHotkey will also run on AutoHotkey_L, with some exceptions (see Warning below).
Commonly-used features include:
* #if expression allows context-sensitive hotkeys to be activated based on whether an expression is true or false.
* Unicode and x64 support for greater portability; Unicode is a must-have for international users.
* COM and ActiveX support, allowing scripts to access many other automation technologies.
* Built-in array support simplifies dealing with lists of values and other data structures.
* Support for icons in menus and numerous enhancements to the Gui commands.
* New built-in variables, functions and other enhancements; read more.
Many more optional features are aimed at experienced users:
* New control flow statements and language capabilities such as Loop..Until, named loops and variadic functions.
* Optional warnings, #Include (Lib) and the local function library are especially useful for larger projects.
* Step through code line by line, inspect variables and more, with interactive debugging features.
* Objects can be used as simple data containers, or behaviour can be customized by scripts.
* Try..Catch and Throw for structured exception handling.</description>
